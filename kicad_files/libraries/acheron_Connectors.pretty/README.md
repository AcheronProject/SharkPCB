## Introduction

Acheron Connectors is the AcheronProject's KiCad footprint library for connectors such as pin headers, USB connectors, JST connectors, ISP pins and so on. Most of these footprints were developed independently using datasheets.

## How to use

1. Clone the git repository into a ``libraries`` folder inside your KiCad project main folder, also known was ``${KIPRJMOD}``.
2. In PCBNEW, go into ``Preferences > Manage Footprint Libraries... `` then under the Project tab, press the plus sign and select the ``acheron_Components.pretty`` folder.
3. After that the library footprints should be available for addition in the PCB layout from the ``Add a footprint`` button. Click that button or press O and try adding a footprint from the library like the ``TYPE-C-31-M-12`` footprint.
