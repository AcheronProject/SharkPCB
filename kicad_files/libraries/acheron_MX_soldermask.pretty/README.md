## Introduction

Acheron MX Soldermask is the AcheronProject's library for MX footprint switches. These footprints have exposed pads on the back of the PCB, but covered in soldermask on the front side. The footprints were independently developed using the MX switch datasheet.

## How to use

1. Clone the git repository into a ``libraries`` folder inside your KiCad project main folder, also known was ``${KIPRJMOD}``
2. In PCBNEW, go into ``Preferences > Manage Footprint Libraries... `` then under the Project tab, press the plus sign and select the ``acheron_MXA.pretty`` folder.
3. After that the library footprints should be available for addition in the PCB layout from the ``Add a footprint`` button. Click that button or press O and try adding a footprint from the library like the ``MX100`` footprint.
