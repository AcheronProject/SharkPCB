# The Acheron Open Hardware License (AOHL) V1.3

## 1 Introduction

This license describes the terms and conditions under which you may use, copy, modify, redistribute the resources hereby published. It also describes how you may make and distribute products based on those project files. It is intended to offer a legal standard by which the authors of these files publish their works, stating their intended use, and establishes a contract between the authors and whoever wishes to use the files.

### 1.1 Definitions

**"Project"**, aliased Acheron Project, means the collective of the design files (such as ECAD/MCAD, 3D models, sheets, texts), visual artworks (logos, labels, fonts), names (public aliases, brands and slogans), documentation (websites, explanatory files like manuals and "readmes") and Intellectual Property rights hereby licensed;

**"Resources"** are the project design files hereby published and thoroughly described in section 1.3 of this licence;

**"License"** means this contractual document;

**"Licensee"** means any person that wishes to use the resources, commercially or otherwise, to whom the licensing rights are given by this license;

**"Licensor"** or "Licensors" mean the legal person or people that own, author, create and modify the resources, publishing and distributing it under the conditions of this licence in the official repository; in this case, the main contributors of the project, namely Álvaro "Gondolindrim" Volpato and Felipe "MrKeebs" Coury, and the personnel involved in its development team. For the purposes of this license, the Licensors may be contacted using e-mails or the GitHub website:

- gondolindrim@acheronproject.com or http://github.com/Gondolindrim for Álvaro Volpato;
- felipe.coury@gmail.com or http://github.com/fcoury for Felipe Coury;

**"Repository"** means a location (generally virtual) where any author has placed the resources for public use, and where it is believed the resources will remain publicly available for at least two years;

**"Licensing Rights"** refer to the rights granted explicitly from the Licensor the the lincensee through this license;

**"Official repository"** refers to the main repository of the project;

**"Product"** means parts or the entirety of a device manufactured or built using the resources as published by the Licensor or a modified version of those resources;

### 1.2 Guide and intended use

This license was written to describe how anyone can make use of the files and resources included in the project's repository, establishing a contractual relationship between Licensor and Licensee. The basic idea is that all resources can be used, copied, distributed and modified free of charge, commercially or not, under certain basic conditions. These will be explained in the below clauses to summarize their intent, and will be thoroughly explained through the license.

**(I)** By using, copying, modifying or distributing the resources hereby licensed, including making products and commercializing them, anyone with access to the resources automatically agrees to comply to this licence and its terms, effectively becoming a Licensee. Any violation of this licence immediately terminates the rights of the Licensee under this license.

**(II)** Any modifications of the files should be dated and thoroughly listed once such modifications are made public;

**(III)** No warranty is given and liability is limited. No responsibility is taken for faults or losses since the resources here are provided "as is". The Licensor shall have no liability for damages like economical or data losses. The use of the resources is given for free under the discretion of the Licensee, and it is the Licensee's responsibility to properly test and/or prototype all the resources before manufacture or commercial distribution. This condition still applies even if the Licensor has already prototyped the resources or parts of them. 

**(IV)** The fact that the resources can be copied, modified and redistributed do not mean that the Licensor endorses or takes part in the development of other projects that may come from its copying, modifying or redistribution. It also does not imply the transfer or assignment of intellectual property or copyright rights to the Licensee;

**(V)** Special care must be taken so as not to make users and consumers believe derivative projects born from modifications of the official repositories are endorsed by the Licensors. If the Licensor has not taken part on those modifications not endorsed them, it is not reasonable that you can say your variation belongs to this project, and hence it as asked that you remove the logos, names and web sites listed on the documentation and the resources (files). This is for both Intellectual Property reasons and so as not to confuse anyone into believing that the Licensor takes part in the design of the derived projects or is affiliated with them. If you want your modifications to integrate the project, you must submit them to Licensor revision and the Licensor must approve the modifications to be submitted to the official repository, obviously with due credit.

### 1.3 Resources

This license applies to all the resources published in the documentation or official repositories, including:

- Printed Circuit Boards ("PCBs"), their schematic diagrams, designs, circuit board layouts and descriptive text;

- The files used for PCBs manufacture like Gerber, SVG and PDF files that describe their mechanical and electrical profiles;

- The Bill of Materials ("BoM"), that describes the components used to manufacture the PCBs, their quantities and models, published in a sheet file or table;

- Parts modelling files like Computer Aided Design ("CAD") and Computer Aided Manufacture ("CAM") files, mechanical drawings and manufacturing, including but not limited to keyboard cases, keyboard plates, enclosures, keycap models and drawings;

- Artworks and graphics, such as images and promotional material;

- The descriptive Electronical CAD ("ECAD") or Mechanical CAD ("MCAD") files such as footprints, symbols, shapes, models and drawings, used in conjunction with ECAD/MCAD software to devise the resources;

This licence does not apply to:

- The software, firmware or code, loaded into programmable devices like microprocessors and microcontrollers, not endorsed by the Licensor. It is perfectly possible that the user wishes to use a third-party firmware in conjunction with the hardware provided in this license; obviously the Licensor cannot represent or speak for that firmware since it was not of their authorship and the use of such firmware is generally subject to proper licensing, terms and conditions;

- The trademarks involved in some components names, brands and logos (for instance, Cortex, ALPS, Cherry, Gateron and so on). All respective brands and logos are proprties of their respective owners; such brands are mentioned only as means of asserting compatibility and usage (for example, "the PCBs use Cortex processors and are compatible with MX-style switches");

## 2 Licensing conditions

This section defines the conditions under which the Licensor gives permission to the Licensee to use, copy, modify and distribute the resources hereby licensed, including for commercial purposes, given that the Licensee complies to the conditions in this section. Such permission is granted by the Licensor, directly to the Licensee, worlwide and without limitation of time.

Should the Licensee violate any of the requirements, their rights under this license are immediately terminated and the Licensor reserves the right to refuse the ex-Licensee any access or rights to the resources.

### 2.1 Copying and modification

The Licensor grants the Licensee worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive permission to copy and modify the resources, given that:

- The modified resources carry legible and clear notices stating they are modified versions of the original project, with date and description of the modifications; the files before and after changes should also be made available. This includes created files such as manufaturing CAD files like STEP files, Gerber files, BoM lists, mechanical drawings and so on.

- The Licensee makes the modfied resources available at the same level of abstraction than the original resources, preferably in the same format of the original resources and in open-source licenses and tools. If you use proprietary formats, you must also include open-format equivalent versions.

- Modified resources have to be licensed under the terms and conditions of this license, a later version of this same license, or a compatible license. Recommended compatible licenses are the [CERN OHL V1.2](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/uploads/631d587b78851f8b2789dff8b2d9790b/cern_ohl_v_1_2.pdf) the [TAPR OHL](https://www.tapr.org/ohl.html) or [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). For more information on how the open-hardware licensing is currently made, see [Ackerman's article](https://www.tapr.org/Ackermann_Open_Source_Hardware_Article_2009.pdf).

It is encouraged that the Licensee use the Git versioning system to manage the changes and publish their modifications at a hosting website that supports Git, like GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. Furthermore, any contributions are welcome, and a pull-request submission is also encouraged.

### 2.2 Manufacture and distribution of products

The Licensor grants the Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive permission to manufacture, distribute and sell any products based on the project's design files. It is required that the Licensee complies with the requirements in section 2.1 and, additionally, that:

- The recipients of such products have easy means of access to a copy of the license and documentation.

- The Licensee inform the Licensor the quantity, dates of selling or production and types of products manufactured.

Failure to comply with any of these requirements will immediately terminate the rights under this license.

### 2.3 Compliance recommendation

To comply with the licensing conditions, the Licensor recommends that the Licensee:

- Include the license file used in a LICENSE file in the documentation package; this makes it easier to understand the licensing terms.

- In the products, if the size and format allows, include a "Lincensed under the AOHL V1.3", substituting the name AOHL for the license used.

- Have a change history included with the files, be it through a CHANGES file included in the documentation or through a commit history;

- Have the original authors know about your distribution and modifications. This can be done via e-mail or through the pull-request system or including detailedly descripted commits.

In order to facilitate the compliance process, all these requirements can be easily fulfilled through the commit and pull request features of the git/GitHub platform.

For commercial licensing, the Licensee can e-mail Gondolindrim at his e-mail gondolindrim@acheronproject.com with the subject "Commercial use of AcheronProject files", describing which repository or resources the Licensee wishes to use, how many will be produced and the date of production.
