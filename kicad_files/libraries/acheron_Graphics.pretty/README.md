## Introduction

Acheron Graphics is the AcheronProject's KiCad footprint library for graphics like flags, logos and signs. Most of these footprints were developed independently.

## Description and credits

- Open-Source-Hardware initiative logos were developed using the official "gear" logo provided in their website.
- Grounding sign, Shock sign and Warning sign footprints were developed independently.

## How to use

1. Clone the git repository into a ``libraries`` folder inside your KiCad project main folder, also known was ``${KIPRJMOD}``.
2. In PCBNEW, go into ``Preferences > Manage Footprint Libraries... `` then under the Project tab, press the plus sign and select the ``acheron_Graphics.pretty`` folder.
3. After that the library footprints should be available for addition in the PCB layout from the ``Add a footprint`` button. Click that button or press O and try adding a footprint from the library like the ``Warning_Sign_3.6x3.2mm`` footprint.
